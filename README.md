I'm learning Swift and found myself in need of some real practical Swift code. So I found [Apple's ListerAProductivityAppObj-CandSwift](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/Lister/Listings/README_md.html) example app. This is in Obj-C/Swift. It targets both iOS and and OSX. This is perfect for me to learn how to create app in Apple's ecosystem. It lets me learn both the tools, development environmant and the new language Swift.

My end goal for this project is to create minimal app with some TBD features, good enough to get this into the App store first for iOS, then OSX. Moving forward from this point to make new apps from here on. How hopefully get to use Apple's arsenar frameworks (Metal, HealthKit, on and on and on and on. And this example app from Apple already contains:

I have literally millions of these domain names and I'm certain each and everyone of them will serve a purpose. As of now, they are hiding in the dark, seeking light....maybe enlightenment

So my first app: 12beenlighten
